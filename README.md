# likemebot

## motivation
I want to connect with people on twitter but I am too lazy to manage it myself

## functionalities
should read the trending topics of the porsche hashtag to it today

and like 5 random ones
retweet one randomly

and store the user matadata in the database, with the like count and retweet count


it should get the list of topics from a source like either website input or a file

it should be able to be set to run once or at an interval
